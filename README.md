# About 
this project is a practice on memory hierarchy

# Memory Hierarchy
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy

there are different types of memory hierarchy but those what we are focusing at:

- Cache
- Buffer
- Virtual Memory

# Note
Although we have made a simple example of Virtual Memory[vm], but virtual memory is not a something u can do with python

vm requires data management and low level access to the physical memory and low level languages
so even with C++ or C still not sufficient

so the main focus here is on Cache and Buffer

Also Note that they are things have not shown in this project, things i remember in my mind, that there is a patterns or mechanism on how to handle cache not just creating a cache function but other things u have to be aware with

also maybe this project wont be much useful because this things usually done by third party services, but it is good to have a look on what is going on and how it is being handle specially for ur studying for alg

# References
Remember to search about Cache mechanisms and functions and Algorithms.
also read about the programming languages used to make Cache functions
i think some of them will be Rust, C#, C, C++, Go, ...etc.
